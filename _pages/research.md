We study how large shocks impact individuals’ skilling decisions using data from a large, government-sponsored, online learning platform in Saudi Arabia. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a massive increase in online skilling, and demand shifted towards courses that offered skills, such as telework, likely to be immediately valuable during the pandemic. Consistent with a model where individuals trade off reskilling costs with their expectations of future labor market conditions and their duration of work, we find that shifts into telework courses were largest for older workers. In contrast, younger workers increased enrollments in courses related to new skills, such as general, occupation-specific, and computer-related skills. Using national administrative employment data, we provide descriptive evidence that these investments in skills in early 2020 helped users maintain employment over the course of the pandemic.

**Trends in International Assessments and Outcomes in Adulthood**. <br/> *R&R at Economics of Education Review* <br/> <small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('pisa_timss')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][pisa_timss] ]</small>

<div id="pisa_timss" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
International assessments such as PISA and TIMSS are widely used to compare the academic proficiency of adolescents across countries and over time. Do scores on these assessments predict outcomes in adulthood? Combining data from PISA, TIMSS, PIAAC, and 18 representative global surveys, I study the relative predictive power of PISA and TIMSS scores among cohorts that took both tests during adolescence. Results suggest that cohorts with higher test scores perform better on assessments of adulthood skills, obtain higher levels of education, and have higher incomes as adults. I find suggestive evidence that PISA scores exhibit a relatively stronger relationship with education and income in adulthood compared to TIMSS scores.

**College Access and Notability in the United States**. <br/> *R&R at Regional Science and Urban Economics* <br/> <small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('college_notability')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][college_notability] ]</small>

<div id="pisa_timss" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
I use comprehensive geolocated data on prominent, famous, and influential Americans across various fields born throughout the 19th and 20th centuries to characterize the distribution and determinants of notability rates across the U.S. I combine this data with information on college site selection experiments—historical instances in which multiple candidate locations were considered as the sites of new colleges—to estimate the effect of college access on notability. Comparing notability rates in counties selected for a college to those in runner-up counties indicates that college placement generates a large, immediate, and persistent increase in notability rates. Analysis of biographical texts suggests that 20 to 40 percent of these effects are driven by college attendance.

**Doing More with Less: School Management and Education Production**. <br/> <small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('jmp')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][jmp] ]</small>

<div id="jmp" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The school superintendent is the highest-ranking executive in U.S. school districts, responsible for managing personnel decisions and overseeing regular school operations. To estimate the causal effect of superintendents on district performance, I collect data on the tenures of over 18,000 school superintendents covering over half of American public school children using a model of test score value-added that allows a superintendent’s effect to emerge over the course of their tenure within a district. Superintendent transitions between districts are leveraged to validate these estimates and to identify common practices of effective superintendents. I show that superintendents have large effects on school district performance, accounting for one-fourth of the observed differences in learning rates across districts. Top management matters most in districts where managerial flexibility is ex-ante largest: smaller districts and districts with weaker teachers unions. Effective superintendents do not change levels of district spending or staffing but instead make changes in school operations, increasing teacher turnover and reducing teacher absences. Finally, I find evidence that the link between value-added and salary for superintendents is strongest in districts with higher levels of local interdistrict competition.

**3G Internet and Human Capital Development** (with [Ronak Jain](https://www.ronak-jain.com/home)). <br/> <small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('3g_human_capital')">Abstract</a> | [Draft][3g_human_capital] ]</small>

<div id="3g_human_capital" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We study the impact of global expansions in mobile internet access between 2000 and 2018 on student outcomes. We link geospatial data on the rollout of 3G mobile technology with over 2 million student test scores from 82 countries. Our findings indicate that the introduction of 3G coverage leads to substantial increases in smartphone ownership and internet usage among adolescents. Moreover, changes in 3G coverage are associated with significant declines in test scores across all subjects, with magnitudes roughly equivalent to the loss of one-quarter of a year of learning. We find suggestive evidence that a reduction in feelings of belonging, ease of making friends, and self-efficacy may explain these impacts.
