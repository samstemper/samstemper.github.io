I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University in the Economics track of the Public Policy Program. My research and teaching interests are in economics of education and labor economics. I have a B.A in Economics from Brandeis University, where I was a Lerman Neubauer Fellow.

While at Harvard, my work has been supported by the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) and the [Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/). As an instructor, I have taught Masters and undergraduate students and received numerous teaching awards.
